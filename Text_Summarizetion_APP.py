    ## Text Summarization Application

    This app allows you to input a text and summarize it using one of the following algorithms:
    - **LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)**
    - **Luhn's Algorithm**
    - **LexRank**
    - **TextRank**

    Simply enter the text, select your preferred summarizer, and specify the number of sentences you want in the summary. The app will process the input and provide you with a concise summary.

    ### How it works:
    1. **LSA** analyzes the semantic structure of the text and selects sentences that capture the most important concepts.
    2. **Luhn** focuses on sentence relevance by selecting sentences with the most important terms.
    3. **LexRank** is a graph-based algorithm that ranks sentences based on their similarity to each other.
    4. **TextRank** uses a similar graph-based method, inspired by Google's PageRank, to rank sentences based on their importance.
                    
    #### How to Use:
    1. Enter your text in the main area.
    2. Choose your preferred summarization algorithm from the dropdown.
    3. Adjust the number of sentences for the summary.
    4. Press the **Summarize** button to get the summarized text.

    Enjoy summarizing your texts!
